# Real time classification of EEG signals using Machine Learning deployment

The prevailing educational methods predominantly rely on traditional classroom instruction or
online delivery, often limiting the teachersâ€™ ability to engage effectively with all the students simultaneously.
A more intrinsic method of evaluating student attentiveness during lectures can enable the educators to tailor
the course materials and their teaching styles in order to better meet the students' needs. The aim of this paper
is to enhance teaching quality in real time, thereby fostering a higher student engagement in the classroom
activities. By monitoring the students' electroencephalography (EEG) signals and employing machine
learning algorithms, this study proposes a comprehensive solution for addressing this challenge. Machine
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for simplifying the analysis of complex variables, enabling the
effective assessment of the students' concentration levels based on specific parameters. However, the realtime impact of machine learning models necessitates a careful consideration as their deployment is concerned.
This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for predicting the level of students' comprehension
with regard to a certain topic. A browser interface was introduced that accesses the values of the system's
parameters to determine a student's level of concentration on a chosen topic. The deployment of the proposed
system made it necessary to address the real-time challenges faced by the students, consider the system's cost,
and establish trust in its efficacy. This paper presents the efforts made for approaching this pertinent issue
through the implementation of innovative technologies and provides a framework for addressing key
considerations for future research directions.
